# Energy-Analytics-and-Development-of-Machine-Learning-Models-to-Predict-Energy-Behavior-of-Consumers


- the summery of project:

“Energy Analytics and Prediction of Consumer Energy Behavior” is an innovative project that integrates diverse data sets to predict and understand consumer energy usage patterns. This project leverages the power of machine learning to analyze data from diverse sources such as gas prices, customer information, electricity prices, and both forecast and historical weather conditions.

- the goal:

The primary goal of this project is to create an accurate and reliable predictive model that helps understand and predict consumer energy behaviors. By analyzing trends and patterns across different data sets, we aim to provide valuable insights to energy providers, policy makers and consumers to make informed decisions.

- methodology:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: A collection of comprehensive datasets from multiple domains. This step involves cleaning, transforming, and normalizing the data to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and interrelationships within the data. This stage is crucial for understanding the basic dynamics of energy consumption.

Developing machine learning models: Using advanced machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. These models are trained and tested on our diverse datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.
